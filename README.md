The ampersand & is a special character in HTML and XML. If you want to use it as a normal character, you have to encode it correctly. Write &amp; instead of &:
& denotes the start of an encoded entity, such as &lt; for <, or &amp; for &. Entities are always terminated by an ;

e.g. https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=JS-API-KEY     &amp;       callback=myMap
